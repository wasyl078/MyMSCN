This project is my example of good code quality and bugless programming (at least in my opinion). My implementation of Multi-echelon Supply Chain Network in C++ does not only give check the quality of given solution, but it can also generate its own as good as possible solution by using algorithm of differential evolution. Additional feature is that it can save results to .csv
## Technologies and algorithms 
I used mostly C++98 features, so the basics of basics. I implemented differential evolution algorithm, by that it should generate quite good solution to any given (inside code or as a file) problem.
## How to check it
Just compile the code in Visual Studio. The file main.cpp already genereates some demo problems and finds best soultion for them.
